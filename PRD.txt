Version

1.0 (Foundational, Mandatory Scope)

Document Purpose

This PRD defines the full functional, technical, and AI requirements for building a global-scale, AI-driven, multi-vendor e-commerce platform where artificial intelligence is not an add-on, but the core operating brain of the system.

1. PRODUCT VISION

To build an AI-first commerce operating system that enables:

Multiple independent vendors to operate stores on one platform

Each vendor to be assisted by a powerful AI acting as a full Chief Operating Officer (COO)

Platform owners (Super Admin) to maintain absolute governance, configurability, and control

Customers to experience intelligent, conversational, personalized commerce

This system must exceed traditional marketplaces (e.g., Amazon, Shopify) by embedding decision-making AI at every operational level.

2. CORE PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

AI is always on
